# Webapp Version of Pomodoro App

I have a [Python script](https://github.com/bliutwo/pomodoro/) version of the app, but it's not easy to install and therefore not accessible for most users. 

Moreover, I want to be able to full screen applications while running this app for my personal use in a cross-platform manner.

## TODO:

The main goal is to get a working version of this app.

- [x] Import base `Pomodoro.py` class
- [ ] Find out from [Glicko-django](https://github.com/bliutwo/django-glicko2) what I need for a working website.
- [ ] Find out if I need business logic from `custom_pomodoro.py`.
- [ ] Front end
- [ ] Back end
