# Webapp Version of Pomodoro App

I have a [Python script](https://github.com/bliutwo/pomodoro/) version of the app, but it's not easy to install and therefore not accessible for most users. 

Moreover, I want to be able to full screen applications while running this app for my personal use in a cross-platform manner.

## TODO:

- [ ] Get a working version of this app.
